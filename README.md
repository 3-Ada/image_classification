## PyTorch Solution

In the `image_classification.ipynb` file, you'll find our approach to the image classification problem. We used PyTorch for preprocessing images and employed a pre-trained model from the timm library. Additionally, we conducted experiments exploring different backbones from the ResNet family.

## TensorFlow Solution

The `intel_image_classification_tensorflow.ipynb` file presents our solution to the classification problem using TensorFlow. This notebook covers preprocessing and the creation of the model using TensorFlow.
